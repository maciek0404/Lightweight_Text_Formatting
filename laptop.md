# Laptop

A laptop (also known asnotebook) is a small, portable personal computer (PC). Laptops typically have a clamshell form factor with a flat-panel screen on the inside of the upper lid and an alphanumeric keyboard and pointing device on the inside of the lower lid. 

Most of the computer's internal hardware is in the lower part, under the keyboard, although many modern laptops have a built-in webcam at the top of the screen, and some even feature a touchscreen display. In most cases, unlike tablet computers which run on mobile operating systems, laptops tend to run on desktop operating systems, which were originally developed for desktop computers.

## Types of laptops

There are many types of laptops available on the market, with ultrabooks and business laptops forming the most popular group. These devices are optimized for mobility—they are light, thin, and offer long battery life. They are often made from high-quality materials, such as aluminum or magnesium alloys, and feature energy-efficient processors sufficient for typical office tasks and web browsing.

A completely different category consists of gaming laptops and mobile workstations. These are computers with significantly larger dimensions and weight, equipped with very powerful processors and dedicated graphics cards. Their priority is high computing power necessary for generating 3D graphics or professional video editing, which comes at the cost of shorter battery life and a louder cooling system.

The third significant group comprises hybrid devices, also known as 2-in-1 laptops (convertibles). They feature touchscreens and a special hinge design that allows the screen to be rotated 360 degrees or completely detached from the keyboard. As a result, the device can function both as a traditional laptop and a large tablet, which is particularly useful in creative work and during multimedia presentations.

## Hardware

The basic components of laptops function identically to their desktop counterparts. Traditionally they were miniaturized and adapted to mobile use, The design restrictions on power, size, and cooling of laptops limit the maximum performance of laptop parts compared to that of desktop components, although that difference has increasingly narrowed.

In general, laptop components are not intended to be replaceable or upgradable by the end-user, except for components that can be detached; in the past, batteries and optical drives were commonly exchangeable. In the past, many laptops featured socketed processors but as of 2025 virtually all laptops use processors that are soldered to the motherboard. Many laptops come with RAM that is soldered to the motherboard and cannot be easily replaced.
